# Sample-Multi-Level-Maze-Solver
# Overview
This program features a multi-level maze solver utilizing the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. It is designed to solve 3D mazes, with each level representing a distinct floor. Transitions between these levels are made via staircases, represented by the number 2 in the maze. The program's objective is to determine the shortest path from a specified starting point to a designated goal point, navigating through the maze and possibly across various levels.
