# Sample-Multi-Level-Maze-Solver
# Overview
This program features a multi-level maze solver utilizing the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. It is designed to solve 3D mazes, with each level representing a distinct floor. Open spaces within the maze are indicated by 0s, while walls are denoted by 1s. Transitions between levels are made via staircases, represented by the number 2. The program's objective is to determine the shortest path from a specified starting point to a designated goal point, navigating through the maze and possibly across various levels.
